//CSS: CASTCADING STYLE SHEETS

    - while HTML is a the skeleton of a website, CSS is the skin. HTML designates where we place out elements, and CSS describes the characteristics of those elements


    //CLASSES & IDS
        
        -id and class attributes allow us to target specific elements in HTML

        CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block;

            Example Format:

                h1 {
                    color:blue;                 (color = property)(blue = value)
                    font-size: 12px             (font-size= property)(12px = value)
                }

        - id, the more specific targeter, can be targeted in CSS using #
        - class, the less specific targeter, can be targeted in CSS using .
        - existing HTML containers do not need either # or . to grab in CSS (ex. h1, p, div, section)


    //MARGIN AND PADDING

        - the "margin" attribute creates space an object has BETWEEN elements OUTSIDE of its container

        - the "padding" attribute creates space AROUND the object INSIDE its container 

    
    //FONTS
        
        - font is an antribute that controls the font of the element, it can further be decribed by color, size, font-weight, text-decoration, etc

    //BACKGROUNDS

        -the background property changes the back drop of the HTML page.

    
    //WIDTHS & HEIGHTS
                
        -width and height properties control the sizing of elements. You can use percentages, veiw heigh and width (vh, vw), pixels, em, or auto (meaning the browser will calculate the size).

    
    //BORDERS

        - "Pseudo classes" allow easier styling in CSS. 

            See pseudo classes on WW3 Schools here:

    //Positions

                - positioning controls the placement of elements in a web page. 
                
                    Fixed: relative to the viewport. Top, right, bottom, and left attribues can be used with "position: fixed"

                    Static: default position.

                    Relitive: similar to static, however you can move things with top, right, bottom, and left. It is useful when you need a little adjusting but DON'T want to alter the flow of the page.

                    Absolute: allows you to place any element exactly where you want it. 

                    Z-index: a property that specifies the stack order of an element.
